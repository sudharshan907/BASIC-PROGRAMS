*Follow order of joins correctly as in the diagram

*abin avoided natural join and used conditions only in most basic way(used alias for shortening table name in conditions-optional)

1)

Query:select distinct did,dname from (directors natural join directs natural join movie natural join productioncompany) where pname='a';
updates:
a)print phno details of directors also bcz it is asked to print all details of directors(i missed this)

2)

Query 1(temporary table):with temp as (select mid,count(cid) as ct from (movie natural join book natural join customer) group by mid)

Query 2:select mname from (movie natural join temp) where ct>='2';

updates:
better to avoid extra temp table and include in single query itself
below query still works according to question,but having said that not sure whether if it is correct or not in cases of diff mid's having same mnames etc
Query:select mname,count(cid) as ct from (customer natural join book natural join movie) group by mname having ct>='2';(not tested in lab by evaluators,just according to abin this also is fine)

3)

Query:select mname from (directors natural join directs natural join movie) where dname='a';


4)

Query:select distinct cname from (customer natural join payment natural join book natural join movie) where ptype='a' and mname='a';

*Didnot do with much interest and some concepts might be unclear in these slides.like some can be open ended,not complete overview like that.just did to impress the evaluator bcz this weightage is 20 marks.

*Try to see this using slideshow only i.e.,in same slide there are stages of content.because i included animations inside ppt ,on clicking enter next stage of same slide will come like that.i used shapes for drawing the diagrams inside some slides in the ppt. 

*Got touch with how to use google slides instead of getting touch with network security concept.

*Got to know that google slides is better to use for preparing slides(ppt) etc like that instead of using powerpoint app which gets stuck suddenly sometimes in my laptop especially.

*At last,sir awarded only 6/20(minimum marks for a submitted student) bcz this topic is not in course plan,even though if i did topic in course plan,i am sure that i would have got less than 10/20 bcz i abstracted out the topic and gave only overview of 3-4 topics.but sir way(only his way-not other teachers way) is only one topic is also enough but explain it completely and matter should be like while a beginner reading a slide,we should also answer what all questions that may rise in his mind in the same slides itself like that or in next slides itself.sir even said a small topic like DVR algorithm only if explained completely by answering all questions that may rise in readers minds,he would have awarded 17-18 marks out of 20.he is like that.dont think all teachers will be like this.This less marks affected my grade in CN,got 7 points if did this good i would have got 8 points.This 20M weightage is very high in the course plan.
